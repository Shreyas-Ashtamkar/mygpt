## GPT-like Text Generation with Streamlit

This project implements functionalities similar to GPT, allowing users to interact with a text generation model through a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

### Features

* Generate text based on user prompts.
* Leverage OpenAI's powerful API for text generation.
* Access data from DeepInfra AI to enhance generation capabilities (details about specific functionalities can be added here).

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit openai [other libraries you might use]
```

2. Create a `.env` file to store your OpenAI API key (refer to OpenAI documentation for key generation).

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Note:** Replace `main.py` with the actual filename of your script.

### Usage

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501/` (default Streamlit port). Interact with the text input field and generation button to experience the application.
